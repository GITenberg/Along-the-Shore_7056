  INLET AND SHORE.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Here is a world of changing glow,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Where moods roll swiftly far and wide;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Waves sadder than a funeral's pride,<br />
  Or bluer than the harebell's blow!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The sunlight makes the black hulls cast<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  A firefly radiance down the deep;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The inlet gleams, the long clouds sweep,<br />
  The sails flit up, the sails drop past.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The far sea-line is hushed and still;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The nearer sea has life and voice;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Each soul may take his fondest choice,&mdash;<br />
  The silence, or the restless thrill.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  O little children of the deep,&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The single sails, the bright, full sails,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Gold in the sun, dark when it fails,<br />
  Now you are smiling, then you weep!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  O blue of heaven, and bluer sea,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  And green of wave, and gold of sky,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  And white of sand that stretches by,<br />
  Toward east and west, away from me!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  O shell-strewn shore, that silent hears<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The legend of the mighty main,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  And tells to none the lore again,&mdash;<br />
  We catch one utterance only: "Years!"<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="impersonality"></a>
  IMPERSONALITY<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  I dreamed within a dream the sun was gold;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  And as I walked beneath this golden sun,<br />
  The world was like a mighty play-room old,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Made for our pleasure since it was begun.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But when I waked I found the sun was air,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The world was air, and all things only seemed,<br />
  Except the thoughts we grow by; for in prayer<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  We change to spirits such as God has dreamed.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="protean"></a>
  A PROTEAN GLIMPSE.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Time and I pass to and fro,<br />
  Hardly greeting as we go,&mdash;<br />
  Go askant, like crossing wings<br />
  Of sea-gulls where the brave sea sings.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Time, the messenger of Fate!<br />
  Cunning master of debate,<br />
  Cunning soother of all sorrow,<br />
  Ruthless robber of to-morrow;<br />
  Tyrant to our dallying feet,<br />
  Though patron of a life complete;<br />
  Like Puck upon a rosy cloud,<br />
  He rides to distance while we woo him,&mdash;<br />
  Like pale Remorse wrapped in a shroud,<br />
  He brings the world in sackcloth to him!<br />
  O dimly seen, and often met<br />
  As shadowings of a wild regret!<br />
  O king of us, yet feebly served;<br />
  Dispenser of the dooms reserved;<br />
  So silent at the folly done,<br />
  So deadly when our respite's gone!&mdash;<br />
  As sea-gulls, slanting, cross at sea,<br />
  So cross our rapid flights with thee.<br />
</p>

<h3>
<a id="power"></a>
  POWER AGAINST POWER.<br />
  [Nathaniel Hawthorne, 1864.]<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Where spells were wrought he sat alone,<br />
  The wizard touching minds of men<br />
  Through far-swung avenues of power,<br />
  And proudly held the magic pen.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  By the dark wall a white Shape gleams,<br />
  By morning's light a Shadow falls!<br />
  Is it a servant of his brain,<br />
  Or Power that to his power calls?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  By morning's light the Shadow looms,<br />
  And watches with relentless eyes;<br />
  In night-gloom holds the glimmering lamp,<br />
  While the pen ever slower flies.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  By the dark wall it beckons still,<br />
  By evening light it darkly stays;<br />
  The wizard looks, and his great life<br />
  Thrills with the sense of finished days.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  A Shape so ghost-like by the sun,<br />
  With smiles that chill as dusks descend!<br />
  The glancing wizard, stern and pale,<br />
  Admits the presence of the End.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Health has forsaken, death is near,<br />
  The hand moves slower, eyes grow dim;<br />
  The End approaches, and the man<br />
  Dreams of no spell for quelling Him.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="priestess"></a>
  LIFE'S PRIESTESS.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  All to herself a woman never sings<br />
  A happy song. Oh no! but it is so<br />
  As when the thrush has closed down his wings<br />
  Within the wood, and hears his hidden woe<br />
  From his own bill fill aisles of leaves, and go<br />
  About the wood and come to him again.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="love"></a>
  LOVE NOW.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  The sanctity that is about the dead<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  To make us love them more than late, when here,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Is not it well to find the living dear<br />
  With sanctity like this, ere they have fled?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The tender thoughts we nurture for a loss<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Of mother, friend, or child, oh! it were wise<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  To spend this glory on the earnest eyes,<br />
  The longing heart, that feel life's present cross.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Give also mercy to the living here<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Whose keen-strung souls will quiver at your touch;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The utmost reverence is not too much<br />
  For eyes that weep, although the lips may sneer.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="one"></a>
  ONE AND ONE.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  The thanking heart can only silence keep;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The breaking heart can only die alone:<br />
  Our happy love above abysses deep<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Of unguessed power hovers, and is gone!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Come, take my hand, O friend I take for life!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  You cannot reach my soul through touch or gaze;<br />
  Be our full lips with infinite meanings rife:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The longed-for words, which of us ever says?<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="violin"></a>
  THE VIOLIN.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Touch gently, friend, and slow, the violin, So sweet and low,<br />
  That my dreaming senses may be beckoned so<br />
  Into a rest as deep as the long past "years ago!"<br />
  So softly, then, begin;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And ever gently touch the violin,<br />
  Until an impulse grows of a sudden, like wind<br />
  On the brow of the earth,<br />
  And the voice of your violin shows its wide-swung girth<br />
  With a crash of the strings and a medley of rage and mirth;<br />
  And my rested senses spring<br />
  Like juice from a broken rind,<br />
  And the joys that your melodies bring<br />
  I know worth a life-time to win,<br />
  As you waken to love and this hour your violin!<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="gertrude"></a>
  GERTRUDE.<br />
  [In Memory: 1877.]<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  What shall I say, my friend, my own heart healing,<br />
  When for my love you cannot answer me?<br />
  This earth would quake, alas! might I but see<br />
  You smile, death's rigorous law repealing!<br />
  Pale lips, your mystery so well concealing,<br />
  May not the eloquent, varied minstrelsy<br />
  Of my inspired ardor potent be<br />
  To touch your chords to music's uttered feeling?<br />
  Friend, here you cherished flowers: send me now<br />
  One ghostly bloom to prove that you are blessed.<br />
  No? If denial such as brands my brow<br />
  Be in your heavenly regions, too, confessed,<br />
  Oh may it prove the truth that your still eyes<br />
  Foresee the end of all futurities!<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="unity"></a>
  UNITY IN SPACE.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Take me away into a storm of snow<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  So white and soft, I feel no deathly chill,<br />
  But listen to the murmuring overflow<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Of clouds that fall in many a frosty rill!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Take me away into the sunset's glow,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  That holds a summer in a glorious bloom;<br />
  Or take me to the shadowed woods that grow<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  On the sky's mountains, in the evening gloom!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Give me an entrance to the limpid lake<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  When moonbeams shine across its purity!<br />
  A life there is, within the life we take<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  So commonly, for which 't were well to die.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="shell"></a>
  THE SHELL AND THE WORLD.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  The world was like a shell to me,&mdash;<br />
  Its voice with distant song was low;<br />
  But now its mysteries I know:<br />
  I hear the turmoil of the sea.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The whirling, soft, and tender sound<br />
  That meant I knew not what of lore,&mdash;<br />
  I dream its mystery now no more:<br />
  Its reckless meaning I have found.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  O shell! I held thee to my ears<br />
  When I was young, and smiled with pride<br />
  To stand aglow at marvel's side!<br />
  O world, thy voice is wild with tears!<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="bell"></a>
  THE CLOCK-TOWER BELL.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Say not, sad bell, another hour hath come,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Bare for the record of a world of crime;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Toll, rather, friend, the end of hideous Time,<br />
  Wherein we bloom, live, die, yet have no home!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Bell, laurels would we o'er thy pulsing twine,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  And sing thee songs of triumph with glad tears,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  If to the warring of our haggard years<br />
  Thy clang should herald peace along the line!<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="endure"></a>
  OURS TO ENDURE.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  We speak of the world that passes away,&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The world of men who lived years ago,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  And could not feel that their hearts' quick glow<br />
  Would fade to such ashen lore to-day.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  We hear of death that is not our woe,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  And see the shadow of funerals creeping<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Over the sweet fresh roads by the reaping;<br />
  But do we weep till our loved ones go?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  When one is lost who is greater than we,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  And loved us so well that death should reprieve<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Of all hearts this one to us; when we must leave<br />
  His grave,&mdash;the past will break like the sea!<br />
</p>

<a id="waves"></a>
  BROKEN WAVES.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  The sun is lying on the garden-wall,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The full red rose is sweetening all the air,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The day is happier than a dream most fair;<br />
  The evening weaves afar a wide-spread pall,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  And lo! sun, day, and rose, no longer there!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I have a lover now my life is young,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I have a love to keep this many a day;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  My heart will hold it when my life is gray,<br />
  My love will last although my heart be wrung.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  My life, my heart, my love shall fade away!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  O lover loved, the day has only gone!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  In death or life, our love can only go;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Never forgotten is the joy we know,<br />
  We follow memory when life is done:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  No wave is lost in all the tides that flow.<br />
</p>

<h3>
<a id="sad"></a>
  WHY SAD TO-DAY?<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Why is the nameless sorrowing look<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  So often thought a whim?<br />
  God-willed, the willow shades the brook,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The gray owl sings a hymn;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Sadly the winds change, and the rain<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Comes where the sunlight fell:<br />
  Sad is our story, told again,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Which past years told so well!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Why not love sorrow and the glance<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  That ends in silent tears?<br />
  If we count up the world's mischance,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Grieving is in arrears.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Why should I know why I could weep?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The old urns cannot read<br />
  The names they wear of kings they keep<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  In ashes; both are dead.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And like an urn the heart must hold<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Aims of an age gone by:<br />
  What the aims were we are not told;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  We hold them, who knows why?<br />

<a id="ghosts"></a>
  THE GHOSTS OF REVELLERS.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  At purple eyes beside the grain,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Our loves on altars we had burned,<br />
  And mixed our tribute with the dew,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Our tears, when rosy dawn returned.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
